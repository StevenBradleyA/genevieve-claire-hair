## Where Beauty Meets Innovation

</div>

</div>

-   Welcome to Genevieve Clare Hair! A cutting-edge application seamlessly blending the power of Next, TypeScript, tRPC, Prisma, and Tailwind with a unique design inspired by the holographic capes Geni uses in her Salon.

-   A fully typesafe serverless website with 3d interactivity, animations, next auth log in, aws cloud storage, and Instagram API integration? Holy pog pogs, Batman.

-   We choose to use Next.js for this project since it has built in support for Server-Side Rendering and Static Site Generation. SSR provided our app with faster page loads and imporved SEO, essentially rendering pages on the server before delivering them to Clients. Prisma was a perfect fit for our type safe front end and backend. It's database agnosticism, real-time data synchronization, and efficient query optimizations also made it a pleasure to work with.

-   tRPC "move fast and break nothing" being able to share types directly between your clinet and server, without relying on code generation. Wrtiing endpoints that you can safely use in both the front and backend of our app. Possibly one of the most fun technologies on this app. Having autocompletion on the client, for inputs, outputs, and errors never got old.

-   3D models were made from scratch in blender. Images were drawn in Photoshop. Spline API was used for camera angles, lighting, animation, and next integration.
